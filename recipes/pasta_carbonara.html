        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The pasta carbonara is a italian classic.<br>
        Creamy and delicious with just 4 main Ingredients!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350 gram spaghetti</li>
            <li>200 gram guanciale</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>100 grams Pecorino Romano, grated</li>
            <li>ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, bring a pot of water to boil while you get the carbonara sauce ready.<br>
            Cut the guanciale into small cubes. Cook it in a skillet over medium heat for 2-3 minutes<br>
            Once the guanciale is ready, turn off the heat, and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Now, let's make the pecorino cream. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and cheese.<br>
            Add the black peper and mix until you have a creamy sauce. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti <em>al dente</em>, following the cooking time of the package.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon for spagheti, drain the pasta when ready. Place them in the skillet<strong> over high heat</strong>,<br>
            to season well with the guanciale.</li>
            <p><strong>The next step is a crucial moment of spaghetti carbonara. Not to put tension on it,<br>
            but this is the fleeting moment in which you can make or break the dish.</strong></p>
            <li>When the spaghetti and guanciale are sizzling in the pan, <strong> Turn off the heat!</strong> <br>
            Otherwise the eggs will cook too much, and you'll end up with scrambled eggs instead of a creamy carbonara!<br><br>
            Right away, pour the egg and pecorino mixture over the hot pasta and stir quickly.<br>
            Since the pan is no longer on the heat, the eggs will cook gently, creating a smooth and creamy texture.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Tip 1:If your carbonara looks too watery, simply mix in a bit more grated pecorino cheese.</li>
                <li>Tip 2:If it seems to thick or sticky, add a tablespoon or two of pasta water to loosen it up.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Serve it on a place and grate with some freshy ground black peppar and pecorino. Enjoy!</li>
